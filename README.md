# Dynamic Virtual Machine Scheduling in Clouds for Architectural Shared Resources

This is a cluster level VM scheduler to avoid the worst case placement of VMs in virtualized clouds. For more information, you can see the paper published in USENIX HotCloud 2012, "[Dynamic Virtual Machine Scheduling in Clouds for Architectural Shared Resources](web.eecs.umich.edu/~ahnjeong/papers/ahn_hotcloud12.pdf)".
